A country has four attributes: name, location, capital, and flag
Given one of the attributes, have the player guess the other three
Each section should have an attribute (map, textbox for country, multiple choice of flags, and textbox for capital)

Flag:
I want a game where I am shown a flag, and given a textbox to guess the country. The input should allow for spelling and capitalization errors. The flag is chosen randomly from the list of UN-recognized nations, also with Taiwan, Kosovo, and Palestine. If a country has several names (Ivory Coast vs Cote d'Ivoire), both should be accepted.

Ask the user to pick between one of three games: Flag given, Country name given, and Capital given. The flag given game should show the user a flag, and prompt the user to guess the country name and the capital. The country name given game should show the user a country name, and prompt the user to guess the capital and the flag. The capital given game should show the user a list of capitals, then prompt the user to guess the country name and the flag. For games where the the user needs to guess the flag, show three other randomly chosen flags along with the correct flag in a row.

To-do:
